# Django - CAE Workspace > CAE Home > Static

## Description
Location for "Static" content, such as css, images, and more.

Essentially, these are files that the end user gets as-is from a url, as opposed to, say, a template which is first
processed by the framework before being rendered.

Static content is almost always grabbed by the template at page load.
