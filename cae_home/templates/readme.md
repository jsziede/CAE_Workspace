# Django - CAE Workspace > CAE Home > Templates

## Description

A standard Django templates directory. Handles what the user sees.

In a MVC (model view controller) framework, this would be where the Views are stored.

Django instead is a MTV (model template view) framework, where the user output is called a "template".
