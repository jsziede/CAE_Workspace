# Django - CAE Workspace > CAE Home > Models

## Description

To help with organization, models are kept in a separate folder instead of a single file.

Models are divided into:
* "User Auth" and "User Account" related models (Users, permission groups, addresses, etc)
* "WMU" related models (Departments, majors, rooms, etc)
* "CAE Center" models (Currently only assets)
